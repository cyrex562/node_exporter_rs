// Systems.
//
// The `exports` map has the following meaning:
//
// The keys in the map correspond to expvar keys, i.e., for every expvar key you
// want to export as a Prometheus metric, you need an entry in the `exports`
// map. The descriptor mapped to each key describes how to export the expvar
// value. It defines the name and the help string of the Prometheus metric
// proxying the expvar value. The type will always be `Untyped`.
//
// For descriptors without variable labels, the expvar value must be a number or
// a bool. The number is then directly exported as the Prometheus sample
// value. (For a bool, `false` translates to 0 and `true` to 1). Expvar values
// that are not numbers or bools are silently ignored.
//
// If the descriptor has one variable label, the expvar value must be an expvar
// map. The keys in the expvar map become the various values of the one
// Prometheus label. The values in the expvar map must be numbers or bools again
// as above.
//
// For descriptors with more than one variable label, the expvar must be a
// nested expvar map, i.e., where the values of the topmost map are maps again
// etc. until a depth is reached that corresponds to the number of labels. The
// leaves of that structure must be numbers or bools as above to serve as the
// sample values.
//
// Anything that does not fit into the scheme above is silently ignored.
